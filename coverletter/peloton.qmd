**Dear Hiring Team at Peloton,**

I am an applied economist and Ph.D. candidate in Agricultural and Applied Economics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My research centers on estimating farm productivity using large-scale, multi-field, and multi-year big data to analyze behavioral changes and their impacts under varying socio-environmental conditions. Given Peloton's need for a data scientist to evaluate user behavior, develop KPIs, and analyze engagement trends, I believe my skills in big data analysis, A/B testing, and behavioral research are a perfect fit.

During my research, I have analyzed how farmers' decision-making behaviors and profitability are influenced by changes in climate, management practices, and governmental policies. This experience directly parallels the challenges Peloton faces in understanding user behavior in the post-pandemic era, where workout preferences have shifted toward outdoor and group fitness settings. By leveraging rigorous data-driven approaches, I can contribute to identifying retention drivers, engagement trends, and user personas to inform strategic decisions.

On my [GitHub page](https://jaeseokh.github.io/), you will find examples of my work, including reproducible research notes and code that underpin my analysis. My projects demonstrate my ability to design and execute large-scale investigations, interpret complex datasets, and deliver actionable insights—skills that align with defining KPIs, measuring feature launches, and leading experimentation processes, as required for this role.

**Key highlights of my qualifications include:**  
- **Advanced Data Analysis**: Proficient in R, Python, SQL, and STATA for analyzing large datasets and running econometric and machine learning models.  
- **Behavioral Research Expertise**: Evaluated decision behaviors in changing socio-environmental contexts, offering actionable insights for stakeholders.  
- **Collaboration & Communication**: Worked with multidisciplinary teams to deliver impactful research, presentations, and publications.

I am excited about the opportunity to apply my skills to Peloton’s evolving business needs. By analyzing behavioral trends and user engagement through a data-driven lens, I can help inform product decisions and optimize the user journey.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to Peloton’s mission and would be happy to discuss my qualifications further.

Best regards,

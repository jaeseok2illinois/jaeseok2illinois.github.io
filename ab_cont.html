        <h2>About</h2>
        <p> I am an applied economist, and data intensive farm experiments and analysis are the center of my research during my 
             Ph.D. program in University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign.
             My research evaluate and cross validate the profitability and rationality of farmer's behavior in making input decision.
            Farm experimental data collected from hundreds of large-scale farms in multiple states in U.S. ,
            government supported or commercial farms in diverse countries like South Africa, Argentina and Ukraine. 
            It incorporates big data cleaning process , data analysis and profit evaluation under the stochastic growing and market conditions.
            To conduct these research, I've been learning spatial regressions and machine learning model like (Xgboost, Causal Forest and Double-Machine learning methods).
             For the more detailed information about my research and how I achieved my skills, please read my posts and look into github codes
